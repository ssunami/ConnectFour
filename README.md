# ConnectFour
An implementation of AI program of Connect Four. 

## Description
This project explores the use of minimax algorithms in the real world.  The example Connect Four AI program in this project utilizes minimax algorithms to select the best decision when playing Connect Four against human players. The program is very successful and performs significantly better than creators. The study also investigates how the program performs against a random column selector and weak AI depending on the search depth of the algorithm, and the result reveals that the algorithm with depth of 3 would be the best model, considering its winning rate and run time costs. This research contributes to the understanding of the use of minimax algorithm and provides practical insight for creators and researchers of Ai programs for two player turn placed games.

## Source Code
Open the Jupytor Notebook (https://github.com/ssunami/ConnectFour/blob/main/ConnectFour_Project_Code.ipynb) 
The Notebook should be loadable in browser. This can also be downloaded locally though requires installing Python and Jupyter.
